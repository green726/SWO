functions:
    functions are declared like this:
    ```
    @foo (arg1type arg1, arg2type arg2) {

    }
```
    functions are called like this:
    ```
    foo(arg1, arg2)
    ```
    SWO builtin functions are called like this:
    ```
    print!(1)
    ```

    for now all functions return ints

    ```
loops:
    Currently only simple index for loop:
    ```
    for (i in 10) {
        print!(i)
    }
    ```

if statements:
    Only single parameter if statements are supported 
    ```
    if (foo == bar) {
        print!(foo)
    }
    ```
    Else statements are simply attached after the if statement 
    ```
    if (foo == bar) {
        print!(foo)
    }
    else {
        print!(bar)
    }
    ```

Variables: 
    Constans are declared like this:
    ```
    const type name = value 
    const int foo = 1
    ```
    mutables (variables) are declared like this:
    ```
    var type name = value 
    var int bar = 2
    ```
